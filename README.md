# Events_Crawler: making a list of events

Events: In this code, the events are exhibitions, seminars, conferences, etc. at main exhibition halls in South Korea (e.g. COEX, KINTEX)

Source: For all the concepts and procedures of crawling pages in this code, I referenced a Nomad Coders' lecture about making Python web scrappers
